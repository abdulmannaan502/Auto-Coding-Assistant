## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Your Coding Assistant

It's quick and easy to get your assistant up and running!

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **(Optional but Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # For Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # For Linux/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install the necessary dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Fire up the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Move into the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Launch the React development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

## üöÄ How to Use Your Auto Coding Assistant

Once both the backend and frontend are running, open your browser and prepare for coding magic!

1.  **Type or Paste:** Enter your natural language prompt for code generation, or paste an existing code snippet into the provided textarea in the UI.
2.  **Generate or Explain:**
    * Click **"Generate Code"** to conjure new code based on your prompt.
    * Click **"Explain Code"** to unravel the mysteries of your provided snippet.
3.  **Voila!** The AI's response will appear right below the buttons.

* **Pro Tip:** Don't worry about hitting the buttons multiple times ‚Äì they'll automatically disable during loading to prevent accidental extra requests.

## üåê API Endpoints at a Glance

For those who love to peek under the hood:

| Endpoint    | Method | Description                         | Request Body Example                                     |
| :---------- | :----- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/generate` | `POST` | Generates code from a prompt        | `{ "prompt": "print hello world in python", "max_new_tokens": 100 }` |
| `/explain`  | `POST` | Explains a given code snippet       | `{ "code": "print('Hello World')", "max_new_tokens": 100 }` |

## üìù Important Notes

* For the code generation and explanation to work their magic, ensure your chosen **AI model (e.g., StarCoder)** is properly loaded and configured within your backend.
* If you're deploying your assistant to a different host or port, remember to **update the backend URL in your React frontend**.
* Don't forget to add `.gitignore` files in both your `backend` and `frontend` directories to neatly exclude virtual environments, `node_modules`, and sensitive environment files from your version control.
